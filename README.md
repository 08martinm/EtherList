# EtherList

Trustless decentralized marketplace with smart contracts.

It's an app built for anyone who ever hesitated when doing transactions with total strangers on the internet.

EtherList is an exchange platform based on EtherRep service.  Imagine the reputation system of Stack Overflow, but decentralized, completely transparent, and available across services. It takes the trust factor out of a transaction, making interaction between individual buyers and sellers an easier and more secure experience.

Decentralized online exchanges such as Craigslist typically involve uncertainty and risk. EtherList takes advantage of using Ethereum's unbreakable smart contracts along with the user rating that is based on community feedback, and enables safe trustless transactions.
 
We've created this to show how any online exchange can be safe and easy.
