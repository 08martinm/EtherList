# EtherList #

Trustless decentralized marketplace with smart contracts.

It's built for anyone who ever hesitated when doing transactions with total strangers on the internet.

EtherList is an exchange platform based on Ethereum's smart contracts. It takes the trust factor out of a transaction, making interaction between individual buyers and sellers an easier and more secure experience.

Decentralized online exchanges involve uncertainty and risk. EtherList is built on Ethereum using unbreakable smart contracts along with the user rating that is based on community feedback, and enables safe trustless transactions.
 
We've created this to make any exchange safe and easy.
